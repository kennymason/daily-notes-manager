# Daily Notes Manager

A Plugin for Obsidian

## Purpose

This plugin is made to handle some automatic Daily Note management for Obsidian.

Unfortunately, this is not meant to offer a wide range of features for people who want to enhance their Daily Note experience. This is simply a result of me wanting very specific functionality and having enough time on my hands to implement it. That being said, feel free to use or modify this code if you find it helpful!

**Note:** There are other plugins that have a lot of the same capabilities, and are more fleshed-out as well. Check out Rollover Daily Todos plugin, for one.

### Features

Some features of this plugin include:
- An 'Archiving' feature, which automatically moves older Daily Notes to a specified folder
- The ability to rollover unfinished tasks from the previous Daily Note
- The ability to copy specific blocks of content from the previous Daily Note (with the ability to specify 'from'/'to' headings)

## Using this Plugin

Download the latest release, and move the folder to the `.obsidian/plugins/` directory in your Obsidian Vault

Enable this plugin in 'Settings > Options > Community Plugins' in your Vault

Configure in 'Settings > Community Plugins > Daily Notes Manager'
